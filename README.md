### Notes
For the sanity of future me:
* Export google calendars to .ics files and convert them to text files using https://icsconvert.appspot.com/
* Use csv-conversion.py to convert the text files into csv
* Yes, you tried using a number of out-of-the-box tools found that some of the times got messed up during conversion. No, don't try it again.
